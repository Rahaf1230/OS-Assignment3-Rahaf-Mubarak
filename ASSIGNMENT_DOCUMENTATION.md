## Part 1: Development Log (1 mark)

Document your development process with **minimum 3 entries** showing progression:

### Entry 1 -May 3, 2026 (3:00 PM)
**What I implemented**: 

I started by analyzing the provided code and identifying shared resources such as counters and execution log.

**Challenges encountered**: 

Understanding where race conditions occur in multithreaded execution.

**How I solved it**: 

reviewed the lecture slides and textbook concepts about race conditions.

**Testing approach**: 
horan the program without synchronization to observe behavior.
**Time spent**: 
2 hours

Entry 2 - May 5, 20
---

### Entry 2 - May 3, 2026 (6:00 PM)
**What I implemented**: 

Added ReentrantLock to protect shared counters (contextSwitchCount, completedProcessCount, totalWaitingTime).
**Challenges encountered**: 
Ensuring correct placement of lock and unloc
**How I solved it**: 
Used try-finally blocks as recommended in OS concepts
**Testing approach**: 
Tested program multiple times to verify consistent results.
**Time spent**: 
1 hours
---

### Entry 3 -May 4, 2026 (7:00 PM)
**What I implemented**: 
Protected executionLog using the same lock to avoid ConcurrentModificationException.
**Challenges encountered**: 
Understanding why ArrayList is not thread-safe.
**How I solved it**: 
lied lock around add() operation
**Testing approach**: 
Ran program repeatedly and checked log size
**Time spent**: 
1.15 hours
---

### Entry 4 -May 5, 2026 (12:00 PM)
**What I implemented**: 
Added Semaphore to control CPU access.
**Challenges encountered**: 
Understanding how semaphore limits concurrent execution.
**How I solved it**: 
Used binary semaphore (1 permit) before process execution.
**Testing approach**: 
Verified that only one process executes at a time.
**Time spent**: 
2 hours
---

### Entry 5 - May 3, 2026 (5:00 PM)
**What I implemented**: 
Final testing, debugging, and validation of output
**Challenges encountered**: 
Ensuring no deadlocks occur.
**How I solved it**: 
Used try-finally to always release locks and semaphores.
**Testing approach**: 
Ran program 5+ times and compared results.
**Time spent**: 
1.5 hours

## Part 2: Technical Questions (1 mark)

### Question 1: Race Conditions
**Q**: Identify and explain TWO race conditions in the original code. For each:
- What shared resource is affected?
- Why is concurrent access a problem?
- What incorrect behavior could occur?
  
**Your Answer**:
First, the variable contextSwitchCount is shared among threads. Multiple threads may increment it simultaneously, causing incorrect values due to lost updates.

Second, the executionLog (ArrayList) is accessed by multiple threads without synchronization. Since ArrayList is not thread-safe, concurrent modifications may lead to inconsistent data or runtime exceptions.

These issues occur because threads execute concurrently without mutual exclusion, leading to unpredictable behavior.

[Your answer here - 4-6 sentences with code examples]

---

### Question 2: Locks vs Semaphores
**Q**: Explain the difference between ReentrantLock and Semaphore. Where did you use each in your code and why?

**Your Answer**:

[Your answer here - explain your implementation choices]

---

### Question 3: Deadlock Prevention
**Q**: What is deadlock? Explain TWO prevention techniques and what you did to prevent deadlocks in your code.

**Your Answer**:

[Your answer here - reference try-finally blocks, lock ordering, etc.]

---

### Question 4: Lock Granularity Design Decision 
**Q**: For Task 1 (protecting the three counters), explain your lock design choice:
- Did you use ONE lock for all three counters (coarse-grained) OR separate locks for each counter (fine-grained)?
- Explain WHY you made this choice
- What are the trade-offs between the two approaches?
- Given that the three counters are independent, which approach provides better concurrency and why?

**Your Answer**:

[Your answer here - explain coarse-grained vs fine-grained locking, independence of counters, concurrency implications. Show understanding of when to use each approach. 5-8 sentences expected.]
